Includes our preliminary results on a Simulink vehicle dynamics model including effects of vehicle longitudinal/lateral slips.

# File structure
* PassVeh7DOF.slx - includes the main model we further simplify upon. This is from Vehicle Dynamics Blockset examples.
* Simplified7DOF.slx - we simplified the model by setting our FWD case and throttle.
* State_Simplified7DOF.slx - tuned the outputs of the model to reflect the states we described.
